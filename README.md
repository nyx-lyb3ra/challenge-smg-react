# Challenge SMG React

This app was built as part of a React challenge. It uses The Movie DB API to
create a basic simulation of a streaming platform.

It uses Vite + React 19, as well as StyleX for its styles. To handle requests,
it uses Tanstack Query's useQuery.

It implements several components that were designed to be used generically by
any application.

## How to Build

To compile and run the application, simply make sure you have Bun installed on
your system, and run:

```sh
bun install
```

After that, you can simply start the development server using

```sh
bun run dev
```
